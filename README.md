========

This Shiny Ap is designed to evaluate the probability of a person's eye color given their sex and hair color.
The data used in the evaluation is from the HairEyeColor dataset which is:
A distribution of hair and eye color and sex in 592 statistics students from a survey of students at the University of Delaware reported by Snee (1974)

Using the conditional probability a plot is developed and the maximum likely eye color identified.
